General Principles
Always provide complete and fully working code for the entire file or function being edited.

Do not use placeholders like ...existing code... — include all existing code in context.

Write clean, maintainable, and well-structured code.

Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

Use descriptive variable and function names (e.g., calculateTotal instead of calc).

Keep code simple and clear, avoiding unnecessary complexity but not sacrificing readability.

Include basic error handling — add try/catch blocks or validation checks where appropriate.

Naming Conventions
Functions and variables: use camelCase.

Classes: use PascalCase.

Constants: use UPPER_CASE.

Avoid single-letter variable names except in short loops.

Code Structure
Imports:

Built-in Node.js modules (if applicable)

Third-party libraries (npm packages)

Local files and modules

Sort imports alphabetically within each group.

Remove unused imports.
